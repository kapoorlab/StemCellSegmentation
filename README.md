# Stem Cell Segmentation challenge resolver : StardistforCurie using 128-256 ray model using custom U-net

Time over for games now we play at the adults table, archived play version of this repo at stardistforcurie at this page

For overlapping cell segmentation using convex polygon approach developed by CSB Dresden for data generated at Institut Curie

[ORIGINAL CODE](https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist)

This package requires python3.5, so to enable Jupyter notebbok a selection between python 2 or 3.5 you have to do:


conda create -n tensorflowpy3pt5 pip python=3.5

pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade
(find the gpu supported python3.5 whl for kepler cluster )

conda install nb_conda

source activate tensorflowpy3pt5

After these commands the usual tensorflow import commands will run fine such as

import tensorflow as tf

import stardist as st

etc

Now you can start a jupyter kernel and select the tensorflowpy3pt5 kernel
